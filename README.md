## First we run the command to start a project in node

```bash
npm init --yes
```

## Then install Cypress on version @4.1 just to teach you how to set the version when installing a package

```bash
 npm install -D cypress@4.1
```

## Create the Cypress folder structure, for that, we use the command:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```
